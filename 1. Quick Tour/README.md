# ðŸ§µ Quick Tour

1. Rust's Variables.

	- Rust's variable declaration is powerful and supports type inference (in case you didn't explicitly mention it) for mutable and immutable bindings.

	```rust
	let mut var_name: f64 = 69.69;
	```

1. Rust Constants.

	- Constants in Rust are a great way to define values that cannot be altered, providing both performance benefits and compile-time safety.

	```rust
	const SCREEN_WIDTH: i32 = 69;
	```

1. Ownership in Rust.

	- Ownership in Rust provides a unique way to manage memory, ensuring that only one owner can modify a value at any given time.

1. Rust Borrowing.

	- Borrowing in Rust provides a safe way to allow multiple references to a value, without allowing mutation or invalidation.

1. Rust Lifetimes.

	- Lifetimes in Rust provides a way to manage the lifetime of references, ensuring that they are valid for as long as they are needed.
